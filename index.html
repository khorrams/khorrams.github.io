				    <h5 align="justify">We introduce an approach for understanding control policies represented as recurrent neural networks. Recent work has approached this problem by transforming such recurrent policy networks into finite-state machines (FSM) and then analyzing the equivalent minimized FSM. While this led to interesting insights, the minimization process can obscure a deeper understanding of a machine’s operation by merging states that are semantically distinct. To address this issue, we introduce an analysis approach that starts with an unminimized FSM and applies more-interpretable reductions that preserve the key decision points of the policy. We also contribute an attention tool to attain a deeper understanding of the role of observations in the decisions. Our case studies on 7 Atari games and 3 control benchmarks demonstrate that the approach can reveal insights that have not been previously noticed.

				    <h5 align="justify">In this paper, we propose Stochastic Block-ADMM as an approach to train deep neural networks in batch and online settings. Our method works by splitting neural networks into an arbitrary number of blocks and utilizes auxiliary variables to connect these blocks while optimizing with stochastic gradient descent. This allows training deep networks with non-differentiable constraints where conventional backpropagation is not applicable. An application of this is supervised feature disentangling, where our proposed DeepFacto inserts a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) layer into the network. Since backpropagation only needs to be performed within each block, our approach alleviates vanishing gradients and provides potentials for parallelization. We prove the convergence of our proposed method and justify its capabilities through experiments in supervised and weakly-supervised settings.

				    <h5 align="justify">The black-box nature of the deep networks makes the explanation for "why" they make certain predictions extremely challenging. Saliency maps are one of the most widely-used local explanation tools to alleviate this problem. One of the primary approaches for generating saliency maps is by optimizing a mask over the input dimensions so that the output of the network is influenced the most by the masking. However, prior work only studies such influence by removing evidence from the input. In this paper, we present iGOS++, a framework to generate saliency maps that are optimized for altering the output of the black-box system by either removing or preserving only a small fraction of the input. Additionally, we propose to add a bilateral total variation term to the optimization that improves the continuity of the saliency map especially under high resolution and with thin object parts. The evaluation results from comparing iGOS++ against state-of-the-art saliency map methods show significant improvement in locating salient regions that are directly interpretable by humans. We utilized iGOS++ in the task of classifying COVID-19 cases from x-ray images and discovered that sometimes the CNN network is overfitted to the characters printed on the x-ray images when performing classification. Fixing this issue by data cleansing significantly improved the precision and recall of the classifier.</h5>

                                    deep learning models is valuable in many domains. In computer vision, computing heatmaps from a deep network is
                                    a popular approach for visualizing and understanding deep
                                    networks. However, heatmaps that do not correlate with
                                    the network may mislead human, hence the performance of
                                    heatmaps in providing a faithful explanation to the underlying deep network is crucial. In this paper, we propose
                                    I-GOS, which optimizes for a heatmap so that the classification scores on the masked image would maximally decrease. The main novelty of the approach is to compute descent directions based on the integrated gradients instead of
                                    the normal gradient, which avoids local optima and speeds
                                    up convergence. Compared with previous approaches, our
                                    method can flexibly compute heatmaps at any resolution
                                    for different user needs. Extensive experiments on several
                                    benchmark datasets show that the heatmaps produced by
                                    our approach are more correlated with the decision of the
                                    underlying deep network, in comparison with other stateof-the-art approaches.

                                    to learn about the high-level concepts that deep learning is
                                    using to make decisions. We propose an algorithm called
                                    Sparse Reconstruction Autoencoder (SRAE) for learning
                                    the embedding to the explanation space. SRAE aims to reconstruct part of the original feature space while retaining faithfulness. A pull-away term is applied to SRAE to
                                    make the explanation space more orthogonal. A visualization system is then introduced for human understanding of
                                    the features in the explanation space. The proposed method
                                    is applied to explain CNN models in image classification
                                    tasks. We conducted a human study, which shows that the
                                    proposed approach outperforms a saliency map baseline,
                                    and improves human performance on a difficult classification task. Also, several novel metrics are introduced to evaluate the performance of explanations quantitatively without
                                    human involvement.
