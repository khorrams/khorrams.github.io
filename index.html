				    <h5 align="justify">The black-box nature of the deep networks makes the explanation for "why" they make certain predictions extremely challenging. Saliency maps are one of the most widely-used local explanation tools to alleviate this problem. One of the primary approaches for generating saliency maps is by optimizing a mask over the input dimensions so that the output of the network is influenced the most by the masking. However, prior work only studies such influence by removing evidence from the input. In this paper, we present iGOS++, a framework to generate saliency maps that are optimized for altering the output of the black-box system by either removing or preserving only a small fraction of the input. Additionally, we propose to add a bilateral total variation term to the optimization that improves the continuity of the saliency map especially under high resolution and with thin object parts. The evaluation results from comparing iGOS++ against state-of-the-art saliency map methods show significant improvement in locating salient regions that are directly interpretable by humans. We utilized iGOS++ in the task of classifying COVID-19 cases from x-ray images and discovered that sometimes the CNN network is overfitted to the characters printed on the x-ray images when performing classification. Fixing this issue by data cleansing significantly improved the precision and recall of the classifier.</h5>

				    <h5 align="justify">We introduce an approach for understanding finite-state machine (FSM) representations of recurrent policy networks. Recent work focused on minimizing FSMs to gain high-level insight, however, minimization can obscure a deeper understanding by merging states that are semantically distinct. Conversely, our approach starts with an unminimized machine and applies more-interpretable reductions that preserve the key decision points of the policy. We also contribute a saliency tool to attain a deeper understanding of the role of observations in the decisions. Our case studies on policies from 7 Atari games and 3 control benchmarks demonstrate that the approach can reveal insights that have not been noticed in prior work.

                                    deep learning models is valuable in many domains. In computer vision, computing heatmaps from a deep network is
                                    a popular approach for visualizing and understanding deep
                                    networks. However, heatmaps that do not correlate with
                                    the network may mislead human, hence the performance of
                                    heatmaps in providing a faithful explanation to the underlying deep network is crucial. In this paper, we propose
                                    I-GOS, which optimizes for a heatmap so that the classification scores on the masked image would maximally decrease. The main novelty of the approach is to compute descent directions based on the integrated gradients instead of
                                    the normal gradient, which avoids local optima and speeds
                                    up convergence. Compared with previous approaches, our
                                    method can flexibly compute heatmaps at any resolution
                                    for different user needs. Extensive experiments on several
                                    benchmark datasets show that the heatmaps produced by
                                    our approach are more correlated with the decision of the
                                    underlying deep network, in comparison with other stateof-the-art approaches.

                                    Network (XNN) to explain the predictions made by a deep
                                    network. The XNN works by embedding a high-dimensional
                                    activation vector of a deep network layer non-linearly into
                                    a low-dimensional explanation space while retaining faithfulness i.e., the original deep learning predictions can be
                                    constructed from the few concepts extracted by our explanation network. We then visualize such concepts for human
                                    to learn about the high-level concepts that deep learning is
                                    using to make decisions. We propose an algorithm called
                                    Sparse Reconstruction Autoencoder (SRAE) for learning
                                    the embedding to the explanation space. SRAE aims to reconstruct part of the original feature space while retaining faithfulness. A pull-away term is applied to SRAE to
                                    make the explanation space more orthogonal. A visualization system is then introduced for human understanding of
                                    the features in the explanation space. The proposed method
                                    is applied to explain CNN models in image classification
                                    tasks. We conducted a human study, which shows that the
                                    proposed approach outperforms a saliency map baseline,
                                    and improves human performance on a difficult classification task. Also, several novel metrics are introduced to evaluate the performance of explanations quantitatively without
                                    human involvement.
